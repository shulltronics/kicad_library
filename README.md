Shulltronics KiCad Library
==========================

This repository contains the symbols, footprints, 3d models, templates, and plugin scripts used in Shulltronics KiCad PCB designs.

### Usage
To use these libraries and scripts, clone this repo in the KiCad "settings" directory. On my Linux machine this is `~/.local/kicad/6.0/`. Open KiCad 6, and add environment variables to point to the respective directories. Then in "Preferences > Manage Symbol Libraries" add in the symbols from this repo, and do the same for the footprints and templates.
